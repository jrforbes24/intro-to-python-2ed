# Introduction to Python 2nd Edition
This is the code for **Introduction to Python 2nd Edition** by Arianne Dee on [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/introduction-to-python/9780135390016/).

Feel free to provide issues, questions, or suggestions through the repository's [issues](https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python-2ed/issues) tracker.

To get started with this course, please follow these instructions:
1. [Download the code](#1-download-the-course-files)
2. [Install Python](#2-install-python3)
3. [Install a code editor](#3-install-a-code-editor)
4. [Check that Python was installed properly](#4-make-sure-you-can-run-the-code)

## Set up instructions

### 1. Download the course files

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.1

At the top of this page (at https://github.com/ariannedee/intro-to-python-2ed),
click the green 
<img src="docs/img/CodeButton.png" style="width: 90px;">
button.

If you have git installed, clone the repository.

If you don't know git, click "Download ZIP",
unzip the folder `intro-to-python-2ed-main`
and move it to a convenient location on your computer.

### 2. Install Python 3

This course requires Python 3.6 or higher to run all the examples.
The video uses Python 3.13.

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.1

You can reference this [Real Python tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python)
for more instructions on how to install Python on your operating system.

Email me at **arianne.dee.studios** at gmail.com if you need help troubleshooting 
your Python installation. 

#### On Mac
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Download the installer for the latest version of Python. 
Follow the prompts to install using the default settings.

#### On Windows
Either download the latest version of Python from the Windows Store,
or download and run the installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

If running the Python.org installer, it will also install the Windows
[Python Launcher](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher).
Before installing, read [this](docs/WININSTALL.md) to see some of the default configurations you may want to change.

#### On Linux
Since there are so many Linux distributions, there is no official installer for Python.

Some options:
1. Use your package manager (e.g. `$ sudo apt-get install python3.12`)
2. Build from source code. See the [CPython tutorial](https://realpython.com/cpython-source-code-guide/#compiling-cpython-linux) for instructions.
3. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) if you're going to be doing data analysis
4. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage and install Python

### 3. Install a code editor

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.2

The video uses PyCharm Community, which is an old edition of PyCharm.

You can now download PyCharm Unified, which provides a free trial of the Pro features 
and is free to use afterwards. The course doesn't rely on any paid Pro features.

You are welcome to use another IDE, like VS Code, Spyder, IDLE, etc.

#### PyCharm
Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/.

**Note**: While the course uses the old Community Edition, you should download the Unified product.

Install, open, and use the default settings.

#### Visual Studio Code
Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.

Once installed and opened, get the official [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

#### Spyder
If you installed Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/),
Spyder will already be installed and available to run via the Anaconda Navigator.

Otherwise, you can use the installer from https://www.spyder-ide.org/ on Mac or Windows.

### 4. Make sure you can run the code

**Note:** There are video instructions in Lesson 1.2

1. Open your code editor of choice

1. Open the `intro-to-python-2ed-main` folder (make sure it's unzipped first)

1. Open the `examples/example_1_first_code.py` file

1. Run it. It should run successfully with no errors.

See Lesson 1.2 for instructions on how to run files in PyCharm and IDLE. 
In VS Code and Spyder, press the green Run arrow.

If you are having errors running the file,
follow [these steps](docs/PYTHON-IDE.md) to configure your code editor with the
correct version of Python (3.6 or higher).

## Troubleshooting

### I downloaded PyCharm, now it's saying I'm on a trial

That is fine. You can use PyCharm with Pro features enabled or with only free features.

Note that your interface might look different than in the video,
which was recorded with an old Community Edition of PyCharm.
